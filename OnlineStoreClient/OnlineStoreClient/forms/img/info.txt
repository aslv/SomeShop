About the Game
The award-winning action RPG is back, bigger and better than ever! Torchlight II 
takes you back into the quirky, fast-paced world of bloodthirsty monsters, bountiful 
treasures, and sinister secrets - and, once again, the fate of the world is in your 
hands!

Torchlight II captures all the flavor and excitement of the original game - while 
expanding the world and adding the features players wanted most, including online 
and LAN co-op multiplayer. Torchlight II is fast, fun, and filled to the brim with 
action and loot. Adventure solo or online with your friends!

Key Features:
Multiplayer - Play co-op with your friends via LAN or over the Internet for free. No 
subscriptions, no item sales. Our new matchmaking service lets you find friends, start 
new games, and join existing games. And, as always, you can play single-player offline 
as well.
Customizable Characters - Players will create and customize a character from one of four
 brand new classes. Each class can be played as either male or female, with customized 
cosmetic features and looks to make each individual character stand out. All new skills 
and loot give loads of opportunity for unique character builds.
Moddability - TorchED, the Torchlight II editor, will give players the ability to create
 their own mods, adding even more content to the world. Have your friends download the 
same mod and play together. TorchED will be available as a separate download very 
shortly after launch.
New User Interface - Torchlight II boasts a new and improved user interface, designed 
to be easier than ever for new players to pick up and play. This intuitive interface 
ensures you can focus on playing the game the way you want to.
Open World - We're not only in the town of Torchlight anymore! Explore vast overland 
areas and multiple hub towns, fight through rain, snow, day and night. Our level
 randomization ensures new layouts, paths, loot, and monsters every time you play.
New Game Plus - In New Game Plus, the game's not over until you say it is. Once you've 
beaten Torchlight II's primary campaign, you can start again with the same character for 
a significantly greater challenge. You'll keep all of the skills, gold, and gear you 
worked so hard for!
Pets & Fishing - These popular features make their return in Torchlight II in improved 
form. More choices, better effects, and your pet will still make the run to town to sell
 your loot so you donít have to.

Do you like running? How about gunning? What if special abilities are thrown into the 
mix? Upgradable weapons? Let's say thereíre dozens of on-screen enemies to unleash this 
firepower on, and as your reward for dispatching them you get experience and gold to 
collect that can be used for character customization and new equipment--all the while
 playing alongside friends in 4-player cooperative play! If you like the sound of all
 this, then you'll love God Mode.

Retro shooter action and RPG elements are combined in this new downloadable 
third-person shooter. God Mode combines non-linear gameplay, fast and frantic 
shooting, hordes of on-screen enemies, a fully functional online coop mode, and 
features visuals and gameplay that rival that of a full-priced boxed title. Matches 
rarely--if ever--play out the same, as dozens of in-game modifiers can significantly 
alter the gameplay on the fly. Characters are fully customizable, both in appearance 
and equipment, which continually evolve. Gold and experience are constantly accrued 
and used to unlock new and satisfying weaponry and unique powerful abilities, both of
 which can be further upgraded.

Key Features:
Cooperative multiplayer for up to 4 players (with special PvP locations)
Collect gold and experience to unlock upgradable weapons and abilities
Extensive character customization
Dozens of Tests of Faith (in-game modifiers) dynamically alter gameplay in each level
